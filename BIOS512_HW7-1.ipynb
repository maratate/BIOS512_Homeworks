    "Answer: A branch is a linear series of commits within the same repository, creating a history of your code. It represents a line of development, and Git tracks which commit is the current “head” of that branch as new commits are made. A branch points to a commit. Whereas a fork is a full copy of a repository that exists separately from the original. Unlike a branch, which stays within the same project and is permanent, a fork is used to develop changes independently."

    "d) Answer: Rebase would be the better option because it keeps the project history clean and linear, which is better for working with multiple collaborators. When Alice rebases, her commits are placed on top of Bob’s, showing the true order of changes without creating unnecessary merge commits. This makes the history easier to read and avoids rewriting the shared history in a confusing way or rude, which can happen with a merge."

    "a) Answer: Interactive staging lets you carefully construct a series of commits, which is useful because it allows you to avoid stopping every few lines of code to make a commit. This is helpful when you have multiple changes in the same file or across several files and want to group them logically into separate commits. By selectively staging changes, you can keep your commit history organized and make it easier to track and understand the work you’ve done."
